# GTA V Legacy Scripts

## Overview
Open-source project focused on scripting for **GTA V on legacy consoles** (Xbox 360 / PlayStation 3).

This repository provides **scripts only** and does **not** include internal source code, natives, or proprietary tools used during development.

## Repository Structure

### `/`
The `.c` files available in this directory are provided **exclusively for analysis and educational purposes**.  
They are intended to help understand how **missions and game logic are structured and implemented** within GTA V.

These files should be treated as **reference material**, not as a complete or buildable source tree.

### `/GTAV/X360/BIN`
The `/bin` directory contains **precompiled Rockstar RAGE-format scripts**, ready to be injected into a potential **Title Update (TU)** or similar runtime environment.

These scripts are already compiled and provided as-is.

## Important Notice
- **Native definitions**
- **Internal source code**

Only the final scripts and selected `.c` files for study and analysis are made available.
